# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt, overwhlemed.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I need to work on my work flow as I tend to keep going for hours on end. 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
When the going gets tough, keep going, a solution will eventually be reached.
